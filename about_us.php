                                        <p>It has been proven over the years that children memorize and remember songs that they listen to much quicker, easier and stronger than things that they read. The sense of hearing is one that does not necessary require strong concentration from the child to acquire knowledge. A child can be doing multiple things like texting, playing with toys and playing with friends and still be listening to her favorite songs playing through his or her headphones or earbud. These songs can be played over and over multiple times and in no time the child has memorized the song and very many other songs in that short period. But these songs, though memorized may not be concretized since spoken words and sang words are usually different and therefore, they are called “Lyrics” instead of “notes” or “literature” or other academic terms. Now imagine a child listening to notes or literature or test books over and over and when he or she can, looking over the actual words? This may help to bridge the disparity between kids whose parents can afford extra classes outside school and the kids who can barely afford to go to school – that is what <?php print  @$siteName?> has come to fulfill.
